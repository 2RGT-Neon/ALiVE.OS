[b]Stability and Optimisation[/b]
Continuing our current theme of stability and optimisation, this release includes a bunch of fixes and tweaks based on feedback and bug reports from our community.  Highlights include an update to civilian stop & search, which makes them more compliant when arrested and allows them to be detained (for their own safety) without playing Houdini tricks when you're not looking.  Infantry units now have the option to deploy boats when advancing across water features, making littoral assaults feasible.  CQB units have the option to deploy static weapons in built up areas, including fixed MG posts and mortars.  In the meantime we're working on a couple of new features including a revamped ambient civilian model and an AI Joint Force Air Component Commander.  Follow our progress on Github!
