[b]AI Air Component Commander[/b]
This update brings the first iteration of the AI Air Component Commander by Tupolov.  While the Military AI Commander is responsible for commanding operations on the ground, the Military Air Component Commander takes control of all air assets in theatre and issues Air Tasking Orders to available aircraft, with the exception of helicopters assigned to logistics taskings.  ATOs are prioritised depending on the tactical situation and available air assets and typically will include Combat Air Patrol (CAP), Defensive Counter Air (DCA) and Supression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) as a priority.  Secondary taskings in support of ground ops include Recce, Close Air Support and Strike missions on the current ground objectives.

The ALiVE MACC module creates an Air Component HQ at the nearest airbase to the module location and optionally spawns Air Defences in the vicinity.  MACC uses existing aircraft spawned by the ALiVE Military Placement modules or, if none are available, can spawn additional fixed wing or rotary aircraft.  MACC is also capable of conducting naval aviation operations from the CVN-83 USS Freedom.  MACC is still very much work in progress and not all features are fully funtional yet so please provide feedback so we can continue to balance and adjust.

Meanwhile there has been a whole lot of map indexing activity from community members, in particular thanks to Burdy323, and the Malden 2035 DLC - thanks to everyone who has contributed!
