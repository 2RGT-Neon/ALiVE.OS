[b]Local Persistence[/b]
Highhead has worked his magic and delivered an option to persist ALiVE missions to your local machine without needing to install a database.  This works in Single Player games or on the hosts machine in Multiplayer, including on dedicated servers.  It's possible to use a scripted autosave option too, though it comes with a health warning: the server will desync for a few seconds while saving large missions.  Reseting persistent missions can be done the same way as before but we have included some extra commands for clearing data from the local ProfileNameSpace manually - details for how to do that are below and will be on our wiki.  Setting up a local database using CouchDB is still an option for those with the technical skills do to so and of course for all those with dedicated servers, the ALiVE War Room is still our recommended method for mission persistence, stats, server monitoring and After Action Reviews.

Meanwhile the rest of the team has been working hard on some major performance improvements.  There is now an option to adjust how fast the virtual profiles spawn when players are within range - slow & smooth helps prevent stuttering on busy missions but may take too long to spawn in for fast moving units such as jets, so adjust to taste.

SpyderBlack continues to enhance his Orbat Tool.  If you have not tried it yet, it's well worth a go.  Many people have released some great new factions using the tool already and remember you don't need ALiVE to use them in missions (though of course we recommend you do!)

Tupolov has returned from the wilderness of no interwebs and responded to a few community requests to index the shiny new Lythium map (welcome back Tup!).  He's also hard at work on an AI Air Component Commander to complement the Ground Ops Commander.  Air Command will issue Air Tasking Orders for all non-logistics aircraft in the AO, providing CAP, DCA, SEAD, CAS and Strike in support of ground forces.  You can see the design work in progress on github.

[b]Local Persistence Usage[/b]
This is the first iteration of Local Persistence so please report any bugs Github.  To use local persistence, select "Local" on the ALiVE Database module and make sure you have persistence enabled on the other modules as normal.  It is recommended you backup your user profile and/or server profile (C:\Users\username\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\profilename).  Use the ALiVE Save & Exit button when exiting the mission to save the mission data.  When you restart the mission, all saved items will load from your ProfileNameSpace automatically - there is no "Load" button.  To clear the save and start over with a fresh mission, either rename the mission pbo or use the following functions in the debug console.  We may add buttons for clearing data in due course.

[i]call ALiVE_fnc_ProfileNameSpaceClear[/i]:  clears data for the current mission only. Note that renaming the mission pbo will also start a fresh instance.
[i]call ALiVE_fnc_ProfileNameSpaceWipe[/i]:  clears all ALiVE data from ProfileNameSpace completely.

For Autosave, put the following in init.sqf
[i]900 call ALiVE_fnc_AutoSave_PNS[/i] where 900 is the save interval in seconds
[i]-1 call ALiVE_fnc_AutoSave_PNS[/i] run at any time will disable autosave

[b]ALiVE War Room[/b]
You can continue to use the War Room for mission stats, server monitoring and AAR with Persistence set to Local but you must run @aliveserver on the host machine, have a War Room account and the server details setup, just the same as now.

[b]Are you using Linux?[/b]
ALiVE is fully supported on a Linux Dedicated Server (as well as Windows). In fact the ALiVE Official Server for testing is running Ubuntu. Here are some tips on getting ALiVE running smoothly on Linux and integrated with War Room - [url=http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux-dedi-server]http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux- dedi-server[/url]

[b]Acknowledgements and Thanks[/b]
Particular thanks to all those on our support forum who have worked closely with us to identify bugs, provide logs and generally help us improve ALiVE. Your assistance is valuable and your dedication to ALiVE makes it all worth the effort!

[b]Disclaimer[/b]
We may need to prune the persistent database data from the War Room, eliminating data that is older than 6-12 months. The ALiVE War Room database is run on a voluntary basis at a cost to the ALiVE development team. No guarantees can be given on the mission data stored or the availability of the service. We apologise for any downtime that may impact your MP persistent missions.

[b]ALiVE has transformed my Arma 3 experience, how can I thank you?[/b]
