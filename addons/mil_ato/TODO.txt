ATO TO DO
- pilots on carrier are spawned underwater :(
- Sometimes crews don't get put in aircraft
- Sometimes aircraft damaged being returned to hangar/carrier position?
- ATM Carrier based aircraft are spawned to avoid exploding issues later - need to fix ship based spawn code in profile system

- make sure reroute is correct - don't reroute twice
- SEAD/STRIKE/CAS/RECCE vs Profiles?
- On demand analysis
- OPCOM ATO request logic
- Crew reinforcement / aircraft reinforcement
- remove OCA/CAP if no planes
- add OCA/CAP if new planes
- Check for AA or AG weapons on aircraft and select assets based on mission
- ATO requests sent to player aircraft if available (via tasks?)
    - CAS, SEAD, Strike, OCA, CAP?, CSAR
- Multiple targets
- Place AA
- Option to include CS assets
- Audio for radio
- Player request handling?
- Spawn Carrier if ATO module over sea
