ATO TO DO

- OPCOM ATO request logic
- Pause between CAPs (random 5-15 mins)
- Aircraft take random (5-10 mins to be refueled/repaired)
- On demand analysis
- if pilot despawned while going to aircraft, getin fails
- check catapult is not in use
- Crew reinforcement / aircraft reinforcement
- Multiple targets
- Place AA
- ATO requests sent to player aircraft if available (via tasks?)
    - CAS, SEAD, Strike, OCA, CAP?, CSAR
- Audio for radio
- Option to include CS assets?
- If crewed vehicle placed by mission maker, get crew out and manage as normal
- Handled profiled crewed planes?
- Spawn Carrier if ATO module over sea

    - profile helo from helipad - done
    

Extra to do....
    SEAD logic 
    - Send SEAD (send 2 aircraft)
    - If aircraft destroyed, request OPCOM take out air defense via ground, halt SEAD for that target
    - Add eventhandler to aircraft, if missile fired at them, register target and create SEAD ATO

	Resupply logic
	- Auto - Aircraft auto replaced after 15 mins if destroyed, if LOGCOM sync'd then aircraft and crew are auto resupplied via LOGCOM
	- None - No resupply of aircraft (No ATO once all airframes lost)
	
	C2ISTAR logic
	- If plane destroyed but pilot survives (and it happens over land), send CSAR/Rescue C2ISTAR task
	- If SEAD not successful, send destroy vehicle C2ISTAR task
	- need to update c2istar tasks to accept pre-existing crashed aircraft, non-profiled vehicle?, pre-existing composition
	- add function to requestPlayerTask
	- decide where to call function, 
	
	On demand analysis? Needed for reinforcement
