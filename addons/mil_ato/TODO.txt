ATO TO DO
- Tests
    - profile UAV from carrier - fails when assets are spawned later in mission?
    - helo from carrier - if spawned, crew don't board?
    - helo/VTOL return to carrier - can't land :(
    - helo/VTOL return to helipad - done?
- Issue where asset is spawned, but no players around impacts takeoff?
- Carrier height changes over time due to sea level??? implement height based relative model position
- Check waypoint completions

- VP integration
- profile UAVs don't have to take off
- make sure reroute is correct - don't reroute twice
- SEAD/STRIKE/CAS/RECCE vs Profiles?
- On demand analysis
- OPCOM ATO request logic
- Crew reinforcement / aircraft reinforcement
- remove OCA/CAP if no planes
- add OCA/CAP if new planes
- Check for AA or AG weapons on aircraft and select assets based on mission
- ATO requests sent to player aircraft if available (via tasks?)
- Multiple targets
- Place AA
- Option to include CS assets
- kickoff rescue mission on downed bird
- Player request handling
- Spawn Carrier if ATO module over sea
