ATO TO DO
- On demand analysis
- if CSAR task successful crew should be added back to ATO.
- if pilot despawned while going to aircraft, getin fails
- Crew reinforcement / aircraft reinforcement
- Audio for radio
- If crewed vehicle placed by mission maker, get crew out and manage as normal
    

Extra to do....
    SEAD logic 
    - Send SEAD (send 2 aircraft)
    - If aircraft destroyed, request OPCOM take out air defense via ground, halt SEAD for that target

	Resupply logic
	- Auto - Aircraft auto replaced after 15 mins if destroyed, if LOGCOM sync'd then aircraft and crew are auto resupplied via LOGCOM
	- None - No resupply of aircraft (No ATO once all airframes lost)
	
	C2ISTAR logic
	- If SEAD not successful, send destroy vehicle C2ISTAR task
	
	On demand analysis? Needed for reinforcement
